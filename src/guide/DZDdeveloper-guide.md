::: tip
The official guide assumes intermediate level knowledge of JavaScript, Docker, Visual Studio Code, data modelling, and transactional business systems. If you are totally new to API development, it might not be the best idea to jump right into a framework as your first step - grasp the basics then come back! Prior experience with other frameworks helps, but is not required.
:::

The easiest way to try out DATP is to following the installation instructions, and then create a simple step, add it to a pipeline, and
test it.

- create class
- register it
- define standard message
- create pipeline
    - check mandatory fields
    - call new step
- map transaction to pipeline
- create test case
    - try without correct fields first
- run test
