A comprehensive development environment for DATP can be downloaded and be up and running within in a few minutes.

This environment uses Visual Studio Code and Docker to run the application and it's database inside Docker containers,
so it can be set up in minutes without leaving residual software on your machine.

::: tip
The official guide assumes intermediate level knowledge of JavaScript, Docker, Visual Studio Code, data modelling, and transactional business systems. If you are totally new to API development, it might not be the best idea to jump right into a framework as your first step - grasp the basics then come back! Prior experience with other frameworks helps, but is not required.

Developers will then want to spend ten minutes running through a walkthrough where you use the Visual Source Code development environment to build and deploy a Step.
