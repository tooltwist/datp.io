## What is Mondat?

**Mondat** is used to **Monitor Distributed Asynchronous Transactions**.

Mondat is a web based dashboard for configuring and monitoring the processing of transactions within the DATP environment.
It used by developers and testers during the development phase, by administrators after production deployment,
and can be used by business teams and customer service to determine the status of transactions.

<!-- ::: tip
Users might see a reduced set of menu options or functionality, depending upon their role, but this guide will explain
these features anyway as it is useful information for anyone using Mondat.

::: tip
If you wish to create your own dashboard, MONDAT can be used as a starting point.
MONDAT is based opn Nuxt and Vue, however it communicates with the DATP server via
an API, so any frontend framework could conceivably be used.
If you wish to develop your own admin or customer service front end, please contact the DATP team.
