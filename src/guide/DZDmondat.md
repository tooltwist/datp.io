## What is Mondat?

**Mondat** is used to **Monitor Distributed Asynchronous Transactions**.

Mondat is a web based dashboard used to configure and monitor the processing of transactions within the DATP environment.
It used by developers and testers during the development phase, by administrators after production deployment,
and can be used by business teams and customer service to determine the status of transactions.

::: tip
Users might see a reduced set of menu options or functionality, depending upon their role, but this guide will explain
these features anyway as it is useful information for anyone using Mondat.
