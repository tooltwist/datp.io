# 11 - Calling DATP from the Browser


In this section we create a quick little client application
that will start a transaction, and then - if necessary - poll
the server for the status, until the transaction completes.

### Generate a default VueJS App.

Reference: [https://vuejs.org/guide/quick-start.html](https://vuejs.org/guide/quick-start.html) .

- We'll let VueJS create a default UI as a starting point. Accept all the defaults.

```sh
cd /workspace/myProject/util-vsc
npm init vue@latest client-browser

cd client-browser
npm install
npm run dev
```
Follow the instructions to see the generated app in your browser.

### Modify this App

- Copy `COURSE-FILES/2.11-browser-client/App.vue` into `myProject/util-vsc/client-browser/src`, to replace the existing file.

This is basically the same application as out example nodeJS client,
but with a simple user interface.
On the page you can see the response from the initial call to start the transaction,
followed by polling calls to get the transaction status.
