# Repy Converter

An application can register a "Reply Converter", to massage the output sent when polling and in the webhook replies.

It receives the DATP transaction summary, does whatever it wants, and returns a new reply and an optional HTTP status code for the polling replies.

```js
function myReplyConverter(txSummary) {
  txSummary.metadata.hello = 'world'
  return { httpStatus: 201, reply: txSummary }
}
DATP.registerReplyConverter(myReplyConverter)
```

If there's anything you don't like in the standard DATP reply, you can change it. It does not neccessarily need to conform to the metadata/progressReport/data format.
