# Introduction to Restify
## 1. Discussion about Restify
- Faster than express
- DATP does not replace the API framework

## 2. Start Visual Studio Code
```sh
mkdir -p ~/DATP-training
cd ~/DATP-training
code .
```

Create a folder named `myProject`, and in that folder create `index.js` containing the example code from the Restify Quick Start guide at http://restify.com/docs/home/.

## 3. Build and run the Restify server

Open a terminal inside VSCode, using 
**&lt;control>**-**&lt;shift>**-**`** and test the Restify server.

```sh
npm init             (accept the defaults)
npm install restify
node index.js
```



## 4. Test with curl
Open another terminal and test using the `curl` command line utility.
```sh
curl -is http://localhost:8080/hello/chuck
-> hello chuck

curl -is http://localhost:8080/hello/norris
-> hello norris
```

## 5. Looking at the code.
This is how a typical Restful API is created.

Note the request/response architecture - the API route is expected to send a response immediately.
