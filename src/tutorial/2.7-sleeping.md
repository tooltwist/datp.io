# 7 - Sleeping

In some circumstances it is necessary to wait for task
to complete before proceeding. For example, in a banking
system we might initiate a transfer with a 3rd party API,
and then wait a period of time before we ask if it has completed.

DATP allows a pipeline to put itself to sleep using
the function `instance.retryLater()`. After the specified interval the step is queued to be re-run. To allow the step to know how many times it has been restarted a _retryCounter_ is incremented each time.

In this exercise we want a step that sleeps once and the proceeds,
so we can sleep if the counter is zero, and continue if the
counter is greater than zero.

:::tip Your mission
- Copy `MySleepingStep.js` into myProject/steps.
- Register the step in app.js.

- Add the step to myPipeline, replacing the existing delay step.
- Restart the server by saving app.js again.

- Run the test for myPipeline and watch the console output from the server.
- In MONDAT you can press the _Refresh_ button to follow the progress.
- The _Cache/Archive_ tab shows the state of the transaction as it progresses.
:::

When a step puts the pipeline to sleep, it goes into hybernation.
At the assigned time, the wakeup processor will add the
transaction back to the queue for the node group.


:::warning Extra
Create another step, named "sleep10", that sleeps for 10 minutes.
