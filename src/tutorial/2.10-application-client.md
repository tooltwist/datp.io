# 10 - Client Application
In this section we create a quick little client application
that will start a transaction, and then - if necessary - poll
the server for the status, until the transaction completes.

1. Create a new folder `myProject/util-vsc/client-app`.

1. Copy `COURSE-FILES/2.10-application-client/app.js` into that folder.

1. Start the app in a VSCode terminal:

```sh
cd /workspace/myProject/util-vsc/client-application
node app.js
```

In the output you can see the initial call to start the transaction,
followed by polling calls to get the transaction status.

:::warning Extra Challenge
1. Try changing the client to call other pipelines.
2. Try starting transactions with the default transaction
starting URL, shown when you start the server.
