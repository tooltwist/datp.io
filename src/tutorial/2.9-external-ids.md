# 9 - External IDs

Up to this point we have been getting the status of a transaction using
the transaction ID returned by the API call used to start the transaction.

But... what happens if there is a network failure during that initial
call? There is no way to know if the transaction started or not, and
no way to know the transaction ID so we can get the result of the
transaction.

To get around this potential scenario, we allow the client to specify
their own unique ID, called an `externalId`.
This is a string up to 32 characters that must be unique.
If the client tries to start another transaction with the same
externalId an error will bre returned.

## Starting a transaction with an externalId
In MONDAT, start the `null` transaction with an external ID by
providing it in the metadata:

```json
{
  "metadata": {
    "reply": "shortpoll",
    "externalID": "abc123"
  },
  "data": {}
}
```

This should complete as expected.
If you then press the _Run Test_ button a second time you will get an error
message.

```json
{
  "code": "Internal",
  "message": "Error: CANNOT CREATE A DUPLICATE TRANSACTION"
}
```

## Getting the status using an externalId

We get the status of a transaction using an externalId in much the same
way as with using a transaction ID.

In Postman, try the following URLs:

`http://localhost:33370/datp/1.0/tx/statusByExternalId/abc123`
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(defaults to shortpoll)
`http://localhost:33370/datp/1.0/tx/statusByExternalId/abc123&reply=longpoll`

In the next section we look at how to call a DATP transaction from
a client application.
