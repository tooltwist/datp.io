# Running inside a Devcontainer

- DATP uses a database and REDIS, also phpMyadmin

- https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers

- Need a diagram about remote containers

- Add dev container definition files, also some useful commands for VSCode

      unzip $C/2.devcontainer/devcontainer.zip
      unzip $C/2.devcontainer/vscode.zip

- Bottom left, Reopen in Container

- Click on show log

- Once running, see that it is a different virtual machine

      pwd
      uname -a

- See the docker containers that have been started

      docker ps

- Connect to the database using phpMyadmin (root / -)
- Run the Restify app again

      node index.js
      curl http://localhost:8080/hello/fred

- Look at the ports tab
